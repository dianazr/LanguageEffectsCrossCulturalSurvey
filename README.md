# LanguageEffectsCrossCulturalSurvey
This is a repository for the data and models used in the paper 'Exploring language effects in cross-cultural survey research: 
Does the language of administration affect answers about politics?' by Diana Zavala-Rojas, Universitat Pomeu Fabra.

The repository contains three *.R files. They are scripts to be run in R Statistical Computing Environment. 
The cvs file called data has the data used in the article. 

The data was obtained thanks to an accepted proposal in the LISS Immigration panel. The LISS panel data were collected by 
CentERdata (Tilburg University, The Netherlands) through its MESS project funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific 
Research.

The original database can be accessed from https://www.lissdata.nl/lissdata/Access_Data/Rules_and_Conditions
