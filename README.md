# LanguageEffectsCrossCulturalSurvey
This is a repository for the data and models used in the paper 'Exploring language effects in cross-cultural survey research: 
Does the language of administration affect answers about politics?' by Diana Zavala-Rojas, European Social Survey ERIC, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, RECSM.

The repository contains three *.R files. They are scripts to be run in R Statistical Computing Environment. 
The cvs file called data has the data used in the article. 

The data was obtained thanks to an accepted proposal in the LISS Immigration panel. The LISS panel data were collected by 
CentERdata (Tilburg University, The Netherlands) through its MESS project funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific 
Research.

The original database can be accessed from https://www.lissdata.nl/lissdata/Access_Data/Rules_and_Conditions

File 1: DataCleaningDescriptives.R

It cleans the data used in the article. 
It reproduces Table 3 to Table 4, which are the descriptive statistics reported in the paper.
It also reproduces the parameters for the simulation reported in the section General Discussion and Appendix 2. 


File 2: Model1Trust.R

It reproduces the analysis reported in the first columns of Table 5 and Table 6 for the Model 1. Trust and change in institutions.
This file also reproduces the global fit indexes reported in Appendix 3.

File 3: Model2Satis.R

It reproduces the analysis reported in the second columns of Table 5 and Table 6 for the Model 2. Fairness, satisfaction and 
change in politics and the economy. This file also reproduces the global fit indexes reported in Appendix 3.
